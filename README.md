## Version 1
 With lots of back-end improvements and the addition of Import / Export OTF, Glyphr Studio has reached
 Version 1 status.  There are still many features left to add, and rough edges to clean up.  But, expect
 a much faster release cadence than the Beta time-frame.  Bug fixes and new features will be pushed to the
 site the moment they are finished! You can see what's new on the [Updates Page](http://help.glyphrstudio.com/overview_updates.html).

## Feedback
 Feel free to get in touch with us via email or twitter or whatever, we always love talking
 to people. There is kind of a running list of feature ideas (and bugs, of course) over at the
 [Issues List]( https://github.com/mattlag/Glyphr-Studio/issues?labels=&page=1&state=open).

## Contributing
 I'm an interaction designer by trade, and have decided to use Glyphr Studio as a giant crash
 course in JavaScript and HTML5.  Since this is my first major HTML5/JS app, there are many
 opportunities for growth & improvement - for both code, and collaborative development styles.

 If you'd like to contribute a feature or bug fix, please make sure to search the issue tracker
 first, your issue may have already been discussed or fixed in master.  After researching, please
 feel free to fork and send a pull request.
